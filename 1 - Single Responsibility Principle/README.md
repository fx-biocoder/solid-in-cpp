# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Description

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a design principle from the SOLID principles that suggests that a class or module should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or job, and it should do that job well.

The SRP is important because it promotes modularization and separation of concerns, which leads to code that is easier to understand, modify, and maintain. By ensuring that each class has only one responsibility, changes to one part of the codebase are less likely to affect other parts of the system. This makes the codebase more robust, reliable, and scalable.

To follow the SRP, it's important to carefully consider the responsibilities of each class or module in the system. If a class has more than one responsibility, it's usually a sign that it needs to be broken up into smaller, more focused components. By keeping classes focused on a single responsibility, you can ensure that they are easier to test, understand, and maintain, which ultimately leads to a more maintainable and reliable codebase.
