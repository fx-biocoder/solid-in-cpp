# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Description

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) establishes that a class or module should have only one reason to change. Which means a class should have only one responsibility or job, and it should do that job well.

The benefit of implementing this principle is that it promotes modularization and separation of concerns. By ensuring that each class has only one responsibility, changes to one part of the codebase are less likely to affect other parts of the system.

It's important to carefully consider the responsibilities of each class or module in the system. If a class has more than one responsibility, it's usually a sign that it needs to be broken up into smaller, more focused components.
